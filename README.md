# ‚≠ê Chel Freitas ‚≠ê

## Description ‚úèÔ∏è

After teaching, I decided to make a career change to web development! As a teacher, I taught middle school introductory computer coding, computer graphic arts, science, and TV Broadcasting.  Also, I taught most subjects in 6th grade.  I did some project management and was trusted to make important decisions. I earned certification in Full Stack Web Development.  Also, I am a volunteer hiking guide, research genealogy in my free time, and have my own genealogy-connected YouTube Channel.  If you are looking for a remote front-end web developer, then I could be the right fit for you and your company!  I am on Linkedin as well: www.linkedin.com/in/chel-freitas-web-developer
