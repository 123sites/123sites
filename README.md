## Description ‚úèÔ∏è

After teaching, I decided to make a career change into web development! As a teacher, I taught middle school technology, science, and TV Broadcasting.  Also, I taught most subjects in 6th grade.  I did some project managing and was trusted to make important decisions.  Currently, I am finishing up a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. Also, I am a volunteer hiking guide, research genealogy in my free time, and have my own genealogy-connected YouTube Channel.  If you are looking for a remote front-end web developer, then I could be the right fit for you and your company! I will be done with Bootcamp this June 2023!  I am on Linkedin as well: ![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white) linkedin.com/in/chel-freitas-7a2a46258
